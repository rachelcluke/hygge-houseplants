# Project Overview

Welcome,

This is Hygge Houseplants e-commerce website, a full-stack (django) site for plant lovers to shop plants for their homes. They will also be able to view what movies other members have been watching. This is Rachel Luke's submission for Code Institute's Fullstacks Frameworks with Django (i.e., Milestone 4).

The following are high-level details of this project:

- This is a Django project backend using a relational database that allows users to store and manipulate data entries (i.e., their plant product purchases).
- The main technologies used are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python+Django, PostgreSQL and Stripe Payments. 
- User functionality is intuitive to users (to create, locate, display, edit and delete records).
- The site has a main navigation in the header and a structured layout.
- Git & GitHub are used for version control.
- Any external code sources used in the project are clearly identified in the code itself and in this README.md file
- The final version has been deployed via GitHub Pages.
- There are no passwords or secret keys in the project repository.
